# Complete Hackathon Coverage Matrix
Comprehensive Strategy Document  
Created: 2026-01-31  
Updated: 2026-01-31  
Purpose: Maximum prize coverage across all hackathon categories, domains, and projects. This update includes diversification of similar domains (e.g., avoiding overuse of document signing themes to reduce suspicion), addition of new ideas like AI-driven unification for block ingestion and inference across networks, and enhanced "glue" through more cross-project dependencies, shared modules, and interconnected architectures for better cohesion and reusability.

PART 2: Domain-to-Project Mapping (All 48 Domains)
Updated to diversify block-related domains: Retained two for document signing to maintain core functionality without over-saturation. Repurposed others to new ideas like block ingestion (a proxy for unified block intake across networks) and AI unifier (a small inference model for standardized outputs regardless of network type, matching a spec for privacy-preserving processing). This adds variety and reduces suspicion of repetitive themes.

PART 3: Project-to-Architecture Mapping
3.1 Core Architecture Components
Expanded with new AI and Proxy sections for the diversified block domains. These add "glue" by integrating with existing AI projects (e.g., deidentify.ai, spacespaceai.com) and creating shared modules for unified network handling, allowing cross-project reuse (e.g., ingestion proxy can feed data to ZK primitives).

CONCLUSION
Maximum Coverage Achieved with Enhanced Ideas and Glue

* 48 Domains → 100% utilized, with diversification to avoid suspicion

* 37+ Submissions → 2+ per prize category, with new AI/proxy ideas

* $160,500+ Potential → All prize categories covered, plus backups

* 12 Architecture Modules → Forked, isolated, and more interconnected

* 100% Competition Coverage → Every prize has 2+ entries

Key Success Factors

1. Every domain connected to a project, with new variety in block themes

2. Every project has architecture backing, with added AI/proxy glue

3. Every prize category has 2+ entries, including novel ideas

4. Forking strategy ensures independence and reusability

5. Complete isolation between submissions, enhanced cohesion via shared modules

Additional Ideas for Expansion:
- Integrate Block Unifier AI with MCP Apps for AI-driven communication unification.
- Use Ingestion Proxy as a gateway for Pyxel DeFi to handle multi-chain inputs privately.
- Potential new prize fit: If a "Best AI Privacy Tool" category emerges, submit Block Unifier AI as primary.
- Glue enhancement: Create a shared "Unify Spec" doc for all projects to standardize outputs, reducing dev time.
